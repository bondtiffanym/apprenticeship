# Phase 5 - *Backend Web Development - MongoDB and Postgres*

This phase will focus on databases. Most teams at Alchemy use Postgres, but MongoDB is also a popular choice paired with Node. You'll be introduced to both options so you can get a feel for the pros and cons of either choice.

#### **Training:**
* Relational Databases
  * Get through all of the lessons in the Intro to SQL course - https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql
  * Install and get familiar with PostgreSQL - https://www.codementor.io/engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb
  * Designing a Restful API with Node and Postgres - https://mherman.org/blog/designing-a-restful-api-with-node-and-postgres/
* NoSQL
  * Watch this intro video about NoSQL - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD3p_rZPBUQ
  * NodeSchool Learn You Mongo - https://github.com/evanlucas/learnyoumongo
  * FreeCodeCamp MongoDB and Mongoose - https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/mongodb-and-mongoose
* Project TBD
  * maybe a todo app api using their choice of database?
  * we could define the endpoints that they would need to implement
  * ask them to re-implement for different users?
